# Win probability in cricket

An attempt to calculate the win probability for every ball in a one-day international (ODI) cricket match.

This project began after I watched India play Zimbabwe in the 2015 Cricket World Cup. [India won with 8 balls to spare](http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/engine/match/656475.html?view=runrate), despite my belief while watching that Zimbabwe had the game in hand.
